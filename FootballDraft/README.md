# Fantasy Football Draft App
We started a dynasty keeper fantasy league 5 years ago and had been using the ESPN Fantasy app for each team and each player, with an excel sheet to keep track of the contracts. Each player has a contract and we pay a certain amount of money to keep that player. After each season, the players that have expiring contracts are added to free agency. Then, to start the season, we have a free agency draft. The draft is why I set out to create an app using Node and exactly why I can help with ESPN fantasy sports.
